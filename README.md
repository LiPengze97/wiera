# Wiera: Policy-driven Multi-tiered Geo-distributed Cloud Storage Instances

Wiera is an open-source policy-driven key-value storage system for geo-distributed cloud environment.


### Goals

* Build an integrated geo-distributed cloud storage system that runs both within and across data-centers owned by different cloud providers

* Provide an easy way to specify policies for multi-tiers accross different cloud providers' DCs

* Provide a first-class support for handling network and application dynamics within the storage policies to achieve user metrics (e.g., reduced cost, latency, and so on)

* Provide a flexibility that allows unmodified applications to furhter reap benefits by replacing data/storage policies externalized at run-time
